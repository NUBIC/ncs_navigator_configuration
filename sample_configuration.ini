# Sample common configuration for NCS Navigator. By default the suite
# applications will expect to find a customized version of this file
# in /etc/nubic/ncs/navigator.ini.

[Study Center]
# Information about the study center which is using this deployment of
# NCS Navigator. Each NCS Navigator instance is only for one study
# center.

# The ID for the study center from the MDES
sc_id = "20000000"

# A pointer to a CSV describing the sampling units for this study
# center.  If the path is not absolute it will be resolved relative to
# this file.
#
# The CSV must have the following header (along with the contents it
# implies):
#
#   PSU_ID, AREA, SSU_ID, SSU_NAME, TSU_ID, TSU_NAME
#
# While this format allows for multiple PSUs, NCS Navigator currently
# only supports one per deployment. This will change in the future
# when multiple PSUs are active per center.
#
# TSU_ID and TSU_NAME may be omitted for centers that are not on
# Hi-Lo.
#
# AREA is an intermediate concept introduced by NCS Navigator. It
# allows the grouping of one or more SSUs for ease of reporting
# something (e.g., outreach events) across all of them. If a center
# doesn't wish to make use of this concept, the AREA should be made
# the same as the SSU_NAME.

# Navigator. E.g., for the Greater Chicago Study Center, this is the
# Northwestern NetID. The default is "Username" if nothing is
# specifed.

# The absolute path to local files containing logos that should appear
# on either end of the footer in Staff Portal and Core.

# The text that should appear in the center of the footer in Staff
# Portal and Core. Line breaks in this text will be preserved.

[SMTP]
# Configuration for the SMTP server for MDES Warehouse, Staff Portal,

# suite. Default is localhost.

# The port to use to communicate with the SMTP server. Default is 25.

# none. Legal values are "plain", "login", or "cram_md5".
